Had Jean-Paul known Nancy, he may have noted that at least one man, someday, might get very lucky, and make his own heaven out of one of the people around him. She will be his morning and his evening star, shining with the brightest and the softest light in his heaven. She will be the end of his wanderings, and their love will arouse the daffodils in the spring to follow the crocuses and precede the irises. Their faith in one another will be deeper than time and their eternal spirit will be seamless once again.\n",
      "Or maybe he would have just said, 'If I would had a woman like that, my books would not have been about despair.\n",
      "'This book is not about despair. It is about a little bit of a lot of things, and, if not a single one of them is wet with sadness, it is not due to my lack of depth; it is due to a year of Nancy, and the prospect of never again being without her.\n",
      "A feedback from Elle on the book\n",
      "This bona-fide wild card of the scientific community writes with eccentric gusto.… Mullis has created a free-wheeling adventure yarn that just happens to be the story of his life.\n",
      "From F. Lee Bailey\n",
      "A very good book by a fascinating man.… [Mullis] enjoys an almost frighteningly brilliant mind and yet somehow manages to keep his feet firmly on the ground.… This guy cuts through the nonsense to the quick, tells it like it is, and manages to do so with insouciance [and] occasional puckishness.… But lighter moments aside, what he has to say is important.\n",
